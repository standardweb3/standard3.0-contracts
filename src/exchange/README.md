## Pre-requisites

Before delving into the Standard monorepo src, ensure your environment is prepared and know how to use these tools.

**Required Tools**:

- [**Foundry**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation): A core development tool for the src.
- [**Forge**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/): An essential package for building and deploying.
- [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install): A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool used to install and manage the project's dependencies.
