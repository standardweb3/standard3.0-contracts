## **Managing Credit and Governance with [pass](./src/pass/README.md)**

The pass app serves as a self-custodial account within the Standard platform, storing credit that revolves around other integrated apps. It allows users to manage their credit lines effectively, facilitating seamless transactions and financial operations across the ecosystem. In addition, the credits earned through pass can be utilized in governance processes within the platform, enabling real users to influence the direction and evolution of the system. With an active subscription status, pass credit holders can even exchange their credits with the company's revenue as part of Standard's unique revenue-sharing business model, further integrating them into the financial successes and opportunities of the platform.

## Pre-requisites

Before delving into the Standard monorepo src, ensure your environment is prepared and know how to use these tools.

**Required Tools**:

- [**Foundry**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation): A core development tool for the src.
- [**Forge**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/): An essential package for building and deploying.
- [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install): A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool used to install and manage the project's dependencies.

To set up these tools, visit their respective [official documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) for [installation instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

## Usage

Navigate your way through the Standard monorepo src with the following procedures:

### 1. Install

Install all the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
```

### 2. Build

Compile the src to ensure they're ready for deployment or testing:

```
forge build
```

### 3. Test

To ensure the src function as expected, run tests specifically for the pass module:

```
forge test --match-path test/pass/*
```

## Security

When working with src, especially in a live environment, security is paramount. Follow best practices and always stay updated with the latest security advisories.

**Guidelines:**

- Always test new code in a sandboxed environment before deploying.
- Regularly audit your src for vulnerabilities.
- Keep private keys and sensitive information secure.

If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please report them responsibly to our team via [official communication channels](mailto:contact@standardweb3.com).
